# Overview
The present document is the presentation of the implementation of the project "Web Application for Short Term Property Leasing" 
which was assigned in the context of the course "Web and Mobile Information Systems" during the Spring Semester 2024. 
The application was developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (for the appearance, decoration and functionality of the pages visited by the user) 
and PHP (for the connection and communication with the database) programming technologies/languages. The database in which records about users, 
properties and reservations are stored has been developed using MySQL. 

Included in this document is the user manual for the application with illustrative screenshots of each page and its functions, as well as an appendix with future additions/improvements that may be added to the application.
